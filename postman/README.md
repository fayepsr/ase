# Postman Collection
You may find instructions as to how to import the postman collection [here](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/). There are two environments to import, one for lightsail and one for localhost.

The two endpoints that are also exposed in lightsail are api/v1/highlight and api/v1/finetune.. 


The two endpoints: http://localhost:5000/predict and http://localhost:5000/finetune are the endpoints of the BaseLearner component (python & JAVA) . These are not exposed on lightsail.
